# ugc-net-score-calculator
This is fun python code to calculate the Marks in UGC-NET exam. Before the release of UGC-NET exam result, UGC releases answer-key and response sheet. To fellows like me who wanted to know their score, as score is not provided by UGC yet (when they release the answer key and response sheet), will have to manually match their reponses with the answer key to calculate the score. And as programmer, I don't believe in manual operations when it can be automated. Therefore, this is a fun, experiment score calculator program. This calculates the total number of correctly answered questions, and prints an array of all correctly answered questions.

# How to use it:
Follow the following steps 
  1. First copy the response sheet from the Response sheet webpage and paste it into the string variable named "response" in the "main.py" python program. "response" is a multi-line string variable
  2. Now copy the answer-key table from answer key page and paste it into the MS-Excel file. Now copy the "correct-option(s)" column and convert it to an array of numbers. Assign this array to "answers" variable in "main.py" python program.
  3. That's it, Voilla! Run the "main.py" python program and Boom. Following is printed by program.
    i. Total number of correctly answered questions
    ii. Total score
    iii. An array of correctly answered questions

Follow these steps, within 2 minutes (just like Meggi) you have your score, while in manual operation it will take around 25-30 minutes and hell of headache is free with such approach.
